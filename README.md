Okay, this is a fantastic request\! We'll create a comprehensive `README.md` file for your "EON Dental" project, which covers React Routing and Authentication. I'll structure it like a professional project README, leaving clear placeholders for screenshots.

## 1. Overview

This project, "EON Dental," serves as a robust demonstration and educational resource for implementing **advanced React Routing and Authentication** within a Single Page Application (SPA). It simulates a dental practice management system, showcasing how to manage different user roles (Admin, Doctor, Designer) with varying access permissions to specific parts of the application.

The core objective is to illustrate best practices for:
* Setting up React Router DOM for declarative navigation.
* Integrating a global state management solution (Redux Toolkit) for authentication status.
* Creating protected routes based on login status and user roles.
* Implementing public-only routes that redirect logged-in users.
* Handling real-world API integration for authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

---

## 2. Features

* **Public Routes**: Accessible to all users (e.g., Home, About).
* **Public-Only Routes**: Accessible only to non-authenticated users (e.g., Login, Register), redirecting if already logged in.
* **Protected Routes**: Require user authentication to access (e.g., Dashboard, Patient List).
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Different routes and UI elements are accessible based on the user's assigned role (Admin, Doctor, Designer).
* **Permission-Based Access**: Granular control over specific features within routes.
* **JWT Authentication**: Secure user login and session management using JWT tokens.
* **Global State Management**: Redux Toolkit for centralized authentication state.
* **Persistent Login Sessions**: User authentication status and token are stored in `localStorage` to maintain sessions across browser refreshes.
* **Programmatic Navigation**: Using `useNavigate` hook for redirecting users after actions (e.g., login, logout).
* **Dynamic Routing**: Handling URL parameters for specific resource views (e.g., `/patients/:id`).
* **Error Handling**: Basic error handling for API calls.
* **Lazy Loading (Optional/Advanced)**: Demonstrates code splitting for performance optimization on route-level components (can be expanded upon).
* **Basic CRUD Operations**: Example implementations for managing patient data (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE).

---

## 3. Authentication & Authorization

The application features a comprehensive authentication and authorization system:

* **User Roles**:
    * **Admin**: Full access to all features, including administrative panels.
    * **Doctor**: Access to patient management, treatment plans, and doctor-specific dashboards.
    * **Designer**: Limited access, primarily to design-related sections.
* **Authentication Flow**:
    1.  User enters credentials on the Login page.
    2.  Credentials are sent to a dummy authentication API (DummyJSON).
    3.  Upon successful login, a JWT token and user details are received.
    4.  The JWT token and user information (including role and permissions) are stored in Redux state and `localStorage`.
    5.  The user is programmatically redirected to their respective dashboard or a default protected route.
* **Authorization (Protected Routes)**:
    * Custom `ProtectedRoute` and `PublicOnlyRoute` components are used to wrap route elements.
    * These components check the `isAuthenticated` status from Redux.
    * For role-based access, `ProtectedRoute` also checks if the logged-in user's role matches the `requiredRole` prop.
    * If authentication/authorization checks fail, the user is redirected (e.g., to `/login` or an "Access Denied" page).

```javascript
// Example of ProtectedRoute usage in App.jsx
<Route path="/dashboard" element={
  <ProtectedRoute>
    <Dashboard />
  </ProtectedRoute>
} />

<Route path="/admin" element={
  <ProtectedRoute requiredRole="admin">
    <AdminPanel />
  </ProtectedRoute>
} />

## 4\. Technical Stack

  * **Frontend**:
      * **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
      * **React Router DOM**: Declarative routing for React.
      * **Redux Toolkit**: Efficient global state management for React applications.
      * **React Redux**: Official React bindings for Redux.
  * **Styling**: (Assumed basic CSS/Tailwind/Styled Components - can be specified if implemented)
  * **API Integration**:
      * **DummyJSON API**: Used for mock authentication and data fetching.
      * **Axios / Fetch API**: For making HTTP requests (can specify which one used).
